# Improving Current Limitations of Deep Learning Based Plant DIsease Identification

Although there has been much success in using deep neural networks to classify plant diseases in a laboratory setting, there has not been as much attention on applying the plant disease classification task to the field. We introduce a two-stage architecture with the goal of creating a lightweight plant disease classifier for plants in a realistic field or home environment. The first stage is a leaf detector that bounds the leaves in the image. The second stage is the plant disease classifier that classifies each bounded leaf image. Using this architecture we achieved a 26.00% accuracy on images of diseased plants in diverse environments.
